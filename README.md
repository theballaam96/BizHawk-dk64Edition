# What is "BizHawk - DK64 Edition"
BizHawk - DK64 Edition is a modification of BizHawk 1.13.2 to work with Donkey Kong 64 ROM Hacks automatically. This fixes some critical bugs that cannot otherwise be fixed with ROM Hacking.

# Can I TAS DK64 with this?
Whilst yes, you can. I would advise otherwise. This isn't normal BizHawk and whilst your TAS should operate as expected when converted to normal BizHawk, such a thing cannot be confirmed for your TAS.

# Can I play other games with this?
I would advise using normal BizHawk as opposed to this.
